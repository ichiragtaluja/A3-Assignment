        A year after the Biden administration took its first major step toward
        restricting the sale of semiconductors to China, it has begun drafting
        additional limits aimed at denying Beijing the technology critical to
        modern-day weapons. But in recent months, its progress has been slowed
        as American chip companies have pushed back with a blunt warning:
        Cutting sales to China would gut their businesses and derail the
        administration’s plan to build new semiconductor factories in the
        United States. Since July, Nvidia, Intel and Qualcomm, three of the
        world’s largest chip makers, have pressed their case that cracking
        down on China would have unintended consequences.

        They have challenged the White House’s national security wisdom in
        meetings with officials like Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and
        Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo, wooed think tanks and urged
        leaders across Washington to reconsider additional chip controls,
        according to interviews with two dozen officials across the
        government, industry and policy organizations. The companies have
        warned that a U.S. pullback could accelerate China’s development of an
        independent chip industry, paving the way to a world dominated by
        Chinese-created chips rather than American-designed chips.
