                Deepfakes use artificial intelligence (AI) to make a video of someone
                by manipulating their face or body. One such video appeared on TikTok
                this week, claiming to be MrBeast offering people new iPhones for $2
                (Â£1.65). Meanwhile, likenesses of BBC stars Matthew Amroliwala and
                Sally Bundock were used to promote a known scam.

                The video on Facebook showed the journalists "introducing" Elon Musk,
                the billionaire owner of X, formerly Twitter, purportedly promoting an
                investment opportunity. Similar historical videos have claimed to show
                him giving away money and cryptocurrency. The BBC approached
                Facebook-owner Meta from comment and the content has since been
                removed. Previously, the videos were gated by an image warning viewers
                that they contained false information checked by independent
                fact-checkers FullFact, which first reported the issue.

                "We don't allow this kind of content on our platforms and have removed
                it," said a Meta spokesperson. "We're constantly working to improve
                our systems and encourage anyone who sees content they believe breaks
                our rules to report it using our in-app tools so we can investigate
                and take action." Meanwhile, a TikTok spokesperson said the company
                removed the MrBeast ad within a few hours of it being uploaded, and
                the account which posted it has been removed for violating its
                policies.
